```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Add secrets to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`**

```toml
[api_tokens]
exporter_auth_token = "your_exporter_token"
openai_token = "your_openai_api_key"

## 🧠 How it works

- User enters an `articleId` from the internal CMS.
- The app fetches the article via the Exporter API.
- It extracts `title` and `text`, and sends them to OpenAI for summarization.
- The summarized result is shown in a text area.

## 🛡 Security

- Secrets like tokens and URLs are stored securely in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- This file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- No user-submitted data is shared unless Evals is explicitly enabled
